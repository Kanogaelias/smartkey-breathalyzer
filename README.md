## Project Description
This is a project based on market research on accident fatalities and is aimed to curb drunk-driving. This is a software-hardware based project

## how it works
- A driver has to blow into the inhaler tube
- The sensor records the alcohol content in the driver's breath
- If the alcohol content exceeds 35microgrammes in 100ml of breath, a buzzer will sound and the car will jam from igniting

- There will be a display of the alcohol content in a lcd screen
